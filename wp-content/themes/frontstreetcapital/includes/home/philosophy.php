          <h3 class="card-title">Ignoring the pack, staying true to our principles</h3>
          <p>We believe that our success is built around a strong commitment to an unchanging set of principles we use to select our holdings. This process has generated returns for our clients and ourselves for the past 30 years.</p>
          <p>Our process looks beyond short term fluctuations and industry cycles that drive stock price, while understanding that even great companies face periods of volatility. Those that stay true to these principles, in our opinion, are the best equipped to navigate these periods to continue to build wealth over the long term.</p>
          <p>Our criteria for selecting companies for long term investment is based upon the company developing a culture that brings out the best in the human spirit by utilizing select management principles.</p>

          <p>We believe strongly in our philosophy and the ability of companies that operate under these principles to produce wealth indefinitely into the future. If we believe a company continues to meet our criteria, the holding period could be forever.</p>
